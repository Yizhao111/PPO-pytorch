# RL-pytorch

This repo includes two classical RL algorithms. I try to keep them clean for learning the core of the algorithms. PPO is based on policy optimizationsation, while SAC Arises from Q-learning.  Currently, parallel training is not supported. 

In the future, I plan to finish:

- The mathematic explanation of the PPO and SAC
- The parallel training via `Ray`

The logging is fully based on `wandb`. For usage, you can check its documents: [wandb][https://docs.wandb.com/]

For running the code, you can easily run them via Jupyter Notebook. (I may later on move them to the Colab for easy usage.)

This repo references the [OpenAI Spinning Up][https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html] and [Machin][https://github.com/iffiX/machin].
